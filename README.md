# Heart-Disease-Prediction

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models are trained and predictions are made with different algorithms. They are:
<ol type="1">
  <li> K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) </li>
  <li> Decision Tree Classifier </li>
  <li> Random Forest Classifier </li>
  <li> Support Vector Machine (Linear) </li>
  <li> LightGBM Classifier </li>
</ol>
